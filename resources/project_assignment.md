## Project Assignment - 2DV611

This text will describe the project assignment for the course 2dv611 at Linnaeus University, Kalmar, Sweden.

### A deployment pipeline

This is a group project where you should develop a deployment pipeline supporting a continuous delivery workflow of an open source application.
The application should be an open source application, which one is up to the group to decide based upon the work you did in the reports.

As the title above suggest, this assignment be about building a deployment pipeline for a developer team to continuously develop an application.
The goal is to achieve a pipeline where a new developer can continue the development of the application in a transparent, easy and quality way.

This assignment will have several parts and learning objectives:

* Getting the understanding for making deployment pipelines, including adding CI-servers, testing and so on.
  * It will first be done in the individual theoretical preparation in the report, then implemented as a group assignment
* Getting a understanding for how to implement testing of software and application in the development pipeline
  * After the report is handed in you will be grouped together and your group will set up the deployment pipeline from the outcomes of the reports
* Working in group with a real software project, The application, using integration techniques using your deployment pipeline
  * Yes, there will be some coding and development, One group, many small commits, code always ready for production
* Automate deployment in different environment maximizing the feedback speed of errors/bugs and the confidence in the code
  * Proper integration tests, notifications when failing and so on
* Getting the code changes all the way to production
  * bla

We will not specify a long list of functional requirement. At this level you should be able to think about the problem and identify wanted features by your self. By reading the literature and article you will get the understanding of the parts implemented in a good deployment pipeline and how to bring your software and code changes to production in a fast, confident and secure way.

#### How to prove you understand continuous delivery

As a group you must prove your deployment pipeline by working on a software running in the pipeline. Hopefully your pipeline will work for a broad spectra of software projects but in this course we will be focus on the application deployment when testing the pipeline. You should not choose a "Hello World-example" application because that won´t test your solution in a good way and you won´t learn how to work as a developer in this kind of environments. We are aiming for continuous Improvement!

To get a better understanding of a more complex software, all project members must be active throughout the development. **Every member of the team should do a lot of commits** and you should use the idea behind continuous integration to get the experience needed.

## Examination

The grade on this part is individual. The grading is from A to F, where F means fail. Here follow a short definition of some of the grades:

There are different examinations in this part

* Oral individual examination
  * Here you have to book a examination time with the course management and you will answer a few theoretical questions from the course.
* Group project
  * The artifact of the group work
* Individual report from the group work
  * In this project you should write a own individual group report to show your own involvement in the project (see below for more instructions)
* Reflection on the other groups work
  * In the end of the course you should reflect on the other groups work when trying there project (see below for more instructions)

### Individual report from the group work

Since the grade is individual you have the chance to reflect over your (and the groups) work in a personal report. It will only be read by the examiners. The goal of the report is to show your involvement and understanding of the project along with a more detailed view of what you have done and how much time you have spend on the assignment. The following part should (at least) be part of the report. Feel free to add own headlines.

* Background of the project
* Choice of technology - with motivation
* Describing the workflows and pipelines in your solution
* Your work
  * What have you done in the project
  * Your time report
* Personal reflection of the project
  * Problems and solutions
  * What is good, what is bad
  * How have the group worked together
  * What have you learn during this assignment
  * What would you done in another way if you had the chance

### Reflection on the other groups pipeline
In this step you should do a group reflection on the other groups work. This means that you as a group should test it and see how easy it is to work with, how the documentation is set up and so on.
Only one report per group.

#### Grading matrix
The final grade (A-F) is a grade based on all the above examination assignments.

A - For an excellent performance - the students have a very good knowledge of the subject and can discuss about the oral questions on a high level. The student have solved the assignments before the deadline and presented artifacts showing he/she have a high level of understanding for all aspects of the relevant material.

C – For a good performance - the students have a good knowledge of the subject and can discuss about the oral questions in a good way. The student have solved the assignments before the deadline and presented artifacts showing he/she have a good level of understanding for all aspects of the relevant material.

E – For a performance meeting only the minimum requirements for acceptance on each examination steps.

Fx – For a performance which does not meet minimum requirements for acceptance on each examination steps.

F – For a performance which is unacceptable in all respects.

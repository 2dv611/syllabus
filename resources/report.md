## Kicking off the project
This text describes the first report in the course 2DV611. This report is a individual written report.

### About the report
In this report you should show that you have a good understanding for the theoretical parts from the first lectures in the course but also done some investigation and thinking before the project assignment starts. The report shall be divided into five different part.

### Part 1 - Introducing the problem context
Iin the first part you shall describe the theoretical framework for the reader of this report. You should concentrate on the first three lectures in the course and try to explain terms and definitions like:

* Continuous Integration
* Continuous Delivery
* Continuous Deployment
* Service deployment platform
* Service deployment patterns
* Delivery pipeline
* ...

In the context of the problem area that are the project assignment later on in this course. Don´t forget to use correct reference handling(IEEE) where needed.

### Part 2 - Investigation of CI-servers
In this part of the report you should investigate and present your findings about at least three different CI-servers that could be used in the project. One of them must be [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) though. Try to investigate them from the point of view of the project later on in this course. Here are some point that at least should be appointed in the report:

* A summery of the core functionality of the product
* The ability to build pipelines
* Description of the license of the product
* Handling of artifacts (building and artifact repository)
* The support for notifications during the build process
* ...

### Part 3 - Finding a interesting open-source project
In this part you shall describe your findings when trying to find an open source project that could be used when building the delivery platform described in the project assignment. You are pretty free to chose what ever project you like but you should be prepared to motivate your choice. There are some point to think about that you should point at in your defending of choice:

* The project should have a test suit since that is an important part of the delivery pipeline and you don´t what to write a whole test suit yourself (in this course)
* Think about the ability to change code. You should try your pipeline solution often and as real as possible so think about the complexity of the project, how easy it will be to make sensible and realistically code changes
* Think about the production part of the project. How easy will it be to put in production? Which components do it need except the application. Is it easy to containerize?
* Do you have some personal motivation for choosing this project? How is it suitable for the project assignment? Do you have a personal interest in this source code?
* Could you identify some risks with your chosen application?
* ...

### Part 4 - A draft of the pipeline
Try to make a first draft of the delivery pipeline that could be suitable for the project assignment. This will not be a final version and hopefully it will evolve during the group assignment but try to create a first version with, what you think is, suitable steps, gates and flows. Where will artifacts be created? Where will they be stored? Identify gates and steps. Notifications?
Remember that this is just a first draw and more of a discussion material for further discussion later on when the group assignment starts.

### Part 5 - Summarize your findings
Your report will be shared to your group members and you will in the group decide what open source project and what CI servers to use. Try to summarize your findings here with the motivation of your choice especially from the point of the project assignment.

### Handing in the report
The report should be sent as an pdf (make sure to include your name on the report) to the course email (2dv611@lnu.se) and to all of your group members before deadline (see course planing). All group members should read each others reports before the first meeting.

### Examination of the report
The examiner will look at these parts:
 * The students knowledge in the area
 * The students ability to search and present information for the reader (including using references)
 * The reflections the student presents from the pre-work step to his/her final solution
 * The effort the student put in the work. **We won't specify number of pages but won´t hesitate to fail reports done with low or none effort.**
